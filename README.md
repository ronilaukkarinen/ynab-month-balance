## YNAB Month Balance

[YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) is a groundbreaking app for personal finance but it (the mobile app especially) doesn't state the current balance between income and expense. This mini app aims to solve that.

What I want is to see in one glance how much there is to budget/spend in this month according to my total monthly income. This can already be seen in desktop reports but it has two problems:

* Reports show only data from already budgeted icome
* Reports are not available on mobile
* Reports won't support "forecasting" based on upcoming income

I love YNAB for its focus on only the money you currently have, don't ever change! But while saying this, it's sometimes nice to know how I'm doing this month only in relation to my month's income rather than rollover-budgets. This app does just that.
