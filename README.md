## YNAB Month Balance

[YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) is a groundbreaking app for personal finance but it (the mobile app especially) doesn't state the current balance between income and expense.

What I want is to see in one glance how much there is to budget/spend in this month according to my total monthly income. This can already be seen in desktop reports but it has two problems:

* Reports show only data from already budgeted icome
* Reports are not available on mobile
